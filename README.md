# PokéStats: Real-Time Pokémon Data Dashboard

## Overview
PokéStats is an interactive web application that visualizes Pokémon data using the [PokéAPI](https://pokeapi.co/).  
The app integrates data science techniques such as clustering and Kalman filtering to explore Pokémon statistics dynamically.  
This project demonstrates how modern web technologies and machine learning concepts can enhance user interactivity and data analysis.

## Features
- Fetches and displays real-time Pokémon data (types, stats, and abilities) using PokéAPI.  
- Implements **K-Means clustering** to group Pokémon by their statistical attributes.  
- Applies a **Kalman filter** to smooth noisy stat readings for improved visualization.  
- Provides interactive charts and data panels for visual exploration.  
- Built with a modular architecture to ensure scalability and maintainability.

## Architecture
The project is structured as a React-based frontend application with a clean separation of concerns:

## How It Works
1. The app requests data from PokéAPI to retrieve Pokémon attributes such as base stats and types.  
2. The data is processed using a Kalman filter to reduce fluctuations and smooth out inconsistencies.  
3. Cleaned data is passed to a K-Means clustering algorithm that groups Pokémon into clusters based on similarity.  
4. The resulting clusters are visualized in a dashboard, allowing users to compare and explore Pokémon characteristics in real time.

## Technical Stack
- **Frontend:** React, Vite, Tailwind CSS  
- **Data Visualization:** Recharts  
- **Algorithms:** Custom implementations of K-Means and Kalman Filter  
- **API:** PokéAPI (REST)

Design Choices and Tradeoffs
Kalman Filter Integration: Introduced for smoothing noisy or missing stat data. However, it increases computational overhead slightly for large datasets.

K-Means Clustering: Provides intuitive groupings but requires manual tuning of cluster counts (k).

React + Tailwind Stack: Enables fast UI iteration and clear separation between logic and styling, though initial setup complexity is higher than simpler stacks.

PokéAPI Dependence: Allows access to rich Pokémon data but may introduce rate-limiting issues with frequent requests.

Limitations
Clustering accuracy may vary based on the normalization of Pokémon stats.

Kalman filter parameters require tuning for optimal smoothing performance.

Visualization updates depend on network speed and API response times.

Future Improvements
Integrate server-side caching to optimize PokéAPI calls.

Add user-defined filters (e.g., type, generation).

Expand statistical analysis with principal component analysis (PCA) for better cluster separation.
