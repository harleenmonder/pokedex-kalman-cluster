# PokéStats

PokéStats is a React-based web application that visualizes Pokémon statistics using data from the [PokéAPI](https://pokeapi.co/). It features data filtering, clustering analysis, and a Kalman filter to smooth performance metrics for better visualization and comparison.

## Overview

This project explores how data science and visualization can enhance understanding of datasets — in this case, Pokémon statistics. It combines web development (React), data analysis (clustering), and signal processing (Kalman filtering) to provide meaningful, interactive insights.

## Architecture

This separation of concerns keeps the app maintainable and scalable: components handle display, utilities handle computation, and hooks manage stateful logic.

Features
Fetches Pokémon data dynamically from the PokéAPI.

Applies a Kalman filter to smooth noisy stat data.

Implements k-means clustering to group Pokémon by attribute similarity.

Displays interactive charts for comparison (using Recharts).

Allows filtering and searching by Pokémon type.

How It Works
PokéAPI Integration
The app fetches data directly from the PokéAPI, extracting key attributes such as attack, defense, speed, and type. These values feed the visualization components.

Kalman Filter
A 1-D Kalman filter smooths Pokémon stat data, reducing variance and outliers for more consistent graphs. It is implemented as a helper in src/utils/kalman.js.

Clustering
Pokémon are grouped using the k-means clustering algorithm based on selected attributes (e.g., attack, defense, speed). Clusters are visualized with color-coded charts to highlight patterns.

Visualization
The project uses Recharts for interactive data visualization (e.g., radar and bar charts). Data flow: API → transformation → clustering → visualization components.

Tradeoffs and Limitations
PokéAPI rate limits can slow large fetches.

The Kalman filter assumes consistent sampling intervals, which may not perfectly match API realities.

Clustering quality depends on feature selection and scaling.

Client-only app; there is no backend persistence.

Future Improvements
Cache API responses for better performance.

Add alternative clustering methods (e.g., DBSCAN).

Introduce authentication and saved user preferences.

Add automated tests with Jest and React Testing Library.
